# Architecture Notes

## Overview
The contract stores proof records submitted by wallet addresses.

## Storage model
Each user address points to an array of proofs.

## Proof structure
- ipfsHash
- timestamp
- submitter

## Flow
1. User sends IPFS hash
2. Contract stores proof
3. Event is emitted
4. Data can be fetched later

## Future improvements
- admin tools
- deployment scripts
- frontend integration
- proof validation
